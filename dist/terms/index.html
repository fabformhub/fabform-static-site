We do not claim, and we cannot guarantee that Services we provide from the United States are or will be appropriate or available for any other location or jurisdiction, comply with the Laws of any other location or jurisdiction, or comply with Laws governing export, import, or foreign use.</li> </ol> <h2>Disputes with Fabform</h2> <ol> <li>If you are upset with Fabform, please let us know and we hope to resolve your issue.
If we are unable to, these rules govern any legal dispute regarding our Services.</li> <li>The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America.
These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.</li> <li>You and Fabform agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find them <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a> or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879).
Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction.
Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis&ndash;class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and Fabform are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.</li> <li>Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in
accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000,
Fabform will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the
arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought
was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.</li> <li>If either you or Fabform intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration
must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the
arbitration. Notice to Fabform should be sent to Fabform at <a href="mailto:info@fabform.io">info@fabform.io</a>. Notice to
you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Fabform has in its records
at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being
sought. If we are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file
a claim for arbitration.</li> <li>Any legal action against Fabform related to our Services must be filed and take place in San
Antonio, TX. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be San Antonio. If for any reason a Dispute
proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out
of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Fabform, will be brought
exclusively in the courts located in the state court located in Bexar County, Texas or the United
States District Court for the Western District of Texas. In such cases, you and Fabform agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Antonio, Texas or
the Western District of Texas, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction
over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.</li> <li>If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the Services in your official
capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not
apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the
laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law
and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Texas.</li> </ol> <h2>Chargeback/Refund Policy</h2> <ol> <li>Customer shall pay the fees applicable to the Paid Plan that Customer selected at the time of initial
sign-up. Customer may opt to upgrade or downgrade to any other Paid Plan that Fabform is
currently offering at any time during Customer’s subscription term; provided that a downgrade will
be not be effective until the renewal of subscription term.</li> <li>All fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, including in case of Customer’s termination of the
subscription term. Customer pays in advance total fees for the subscription term, and in advance at
renewal for any renewal term. No refunds will be provided for the unused portion of the
subscription term or renewal term in case of termination. Following any termination, however,
Customer will continue to have access to the Paid Plan Services through the end of Customer’s then-
current subscription term.</li> <li>Fabform reserves the right to change the fees or to institute new charges or to otherwise change
the terms and conditions applicable to the Paid Plans; provided, however, that any such changes will
apply only (a) to new Services procured after the changes; and (b) to continuing Services for any
renewal term(s) starting after notice of such changes was provided or such earlier time as Customer
